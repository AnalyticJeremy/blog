Hello!  My name is Jeremy Peach, and I'm a data scientist.  For my day job, I work as a Cloud Solution Architect at
[Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) where I help customers with cloud-scale data science.
In my spare time, I apply those same skills to satisfy my own personal curiosity.

This blog gives me a platform to share these personal data analyses with the rest of the world.  Most will be frivilous,
but some may be serious.  They all reflect my desire to find some new insight in the data around us or to explore new
data analysis techniques.
